### Step 1: Create an Azure Virtual Machine
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>
Within Azure, click "virtual machines" at the top of the home page. Next, click the "Create" button at the top right of your screen and select "Virtual machine." 
Next, input your project details. 
<ul>
<li>Under resource groups, create a new one for this project.</li>
<li>Under Image, select "Windows 10 Pro, Version 22H2 - x64 Gen2."</li>`
<li>Under size, select 2 vcpus.</li>
<li>At the bottom check the licensing box.</li>
</ul>
You can give your virtual machine any name you would like. I would suggest documenting the username and password you create for your virtual machine, as we will need them to log in later.
</p>
<p>
Then click "Review + create" in the bottom right of your screen, and click "create" in the bottom right of the next screen.
Once your virtual machine has been created you can remotely connect to it.
</p>
<p>
First, open the "Remote Desktop Connection" application, which you can find by searching for it in the start menu.
</p>
<p>
Next, within Azure, view your virtual machine and copy it's public ip address on the right side of the screen. Paste the address into the Remote Desktop Connection application and click "connect."
</p>
Then, enter the username and password you created for your virtual machine and click "connect."
</p>

Once the file is downloaded, click the manila folder in the top right,
right click the file named "osTicket-Installation-Files," and extract the file to your desktop.
